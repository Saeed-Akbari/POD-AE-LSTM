"Numerical assessments of a nonintrusive surrogate model based on recurrent neural networks and proper orthogonal decomposition: Rayleigh Bénard convection"

Authors: Saeed Akbari, Suraj Pawar, Omer San

Journal: International Journal of Computational Fluid Dynamics

# Dataset

All the files required to simulate Rayleigh-Bénard convection are in the FOM folder.
Inputs of the full order model is in a yaml file (FOM/config/rbc_parameters.yaml). After specifying desired inputs, FOM/ns2d_ws_rbc.py must be executed to simulate flow.
The FOM data must be collected to be used for building the nonintrusive reduced order model.
Details of the numerical schemes are in the paper.
